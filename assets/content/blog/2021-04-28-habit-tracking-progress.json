It has been more than 100 days since I started and here is what I have learned:\n\n1. Humans are creatures of habit and we are very…simple. Just conditioning myself to check off a box made me drag myself to run or do my skincare\n2. You will have off days and it is fine. Measure when and where you are missing and try again next time.\n3. Boring consistency works positively or negatively. Consistently overeating or smoking will manifest itself negatively. Same rule applies in positive habits. You may not see the difference in a week or a month but keep at it and the results will manifest itself.\n\nAnd that’s my 100 days journey in tracking my habits. Kilograms were lost. Kilometers were ran. Chords were practiced. But alarms were still snoozed. Regardless, time to keep at it."
