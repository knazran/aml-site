  "body": "*First published on LinkedIn, as seen [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6749993837302824960/):* \n\nAs the year comes to an end, I would like to celebrate some of my career-related (and adjacent) highlights in 2020\n\n- Got promoted to a Data Engineer at work and naturally, my work got a lot more technical this year.\\\n- Challenged myself to do a more self-paced version of [\\#100DaysOfCode](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=100daysofcode&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6749993837302824960) from April to July. I did this challenge to further hone my modern web development skills. Got significantly better in web development and gave me confidence with my capabilities in this area.\\\n- I entered 3 hackathons this year and managed to win awards in all of them.\\\n- Launched my personal portfolio site back in June and have been diligently updating it with my involvements throughout the year.\\\n- Reconnected with my love and passion for startups and product-building. Got involved with the Malaysians Who Make community ( <https://lnkd.in/gqEv9Bb>) and been reading voraciously into the space. Maybe I'll launch my own micro-SaaS in future?\\\n- Spoke for a Fireside Chat event organised by PyData and got involved with the PyDataKL community. Hopefully I can continue contributing and interacting in that community.\\\n\\\nHow does 2021 look like? Well, some plans are better left unspoken until its executed, no? Here's to the eventful year that is 2020.",
